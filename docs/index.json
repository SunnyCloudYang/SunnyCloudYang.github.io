[{"content":"Well, as you can see, it\u0026rsquo;s my personal blog.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s still at the demo stage, so there aren\u0026rsquo;t so many interesting things yet, but I\u0026rsquo;ll find and add them here gradually.\nWish you have fun here!\n","permalink":"https://sunnycloudyang.github.io/posts/post/","summary":"Happy to see you here.","title":"Some Explanations [Stick]"},{"content":" This blogpost knows that its biggest role, is just to take up some place to make it seems meaningful.\n\u0026ldquo;Like the zero in mathematics\u0026rdquo;, it thought.\nFinally, the first commit of this holiday fulfilled my \u0026ldquo;grand\u0026rdquo; blueprint \u0026ndash; a blog. To be honest, it\u0026rsquo;s not very hard to build a thing like this. But it still took me nearly two days.\nI remembered that my first \u0026ldquo;blog-like thing\u0026rdquo; was the Bounce Balls. The homepage perhaps can be considered as half a blog, but it was just so boring to watch a bounch of balls bouncing around, so I came up with the idea of a formal blog.\nI thought of pure \u0026ldquo;hand-made\u0026rdquo; website firstly, but the workload will be too heavy for me to finish it in my vacation, so I turned to Hugo (from GitHub\u0026rsquo;s JekyII).After the whole process, I found that the most difficult thing is to take a seriously look at the tutorial. I remember that Bounce Balls\u0026rsquo; homepage also has a long tutorial of my own, with the words \u0026ldquo;Please read this tutorial carefully\u0026rdquo; in big bold letters. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to walk through a tutorial on a small game that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any technical requirements, but it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to talk about a technical tutorial that is a bit brain-burning and full of incomprehensible aspects.\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s my first and biggest challenge during my setup. There is such a line in the tutorial:\n1 publishDir = \u0026#39;docs\u0026#39; which I didn\u0026rsquo;t see. So I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t deploy it to GitHub Pages. And I was so anxious that I finally took a look at the tutorial and GitHub build requirements. It was finally successful.\nIt seems that being able to listen carefully and fully understand others is a rare skill.\nOn top of that, the biggest difficulty in building it, and the biggest difficulty right now, is figuring out what all these configurations do, and for the foreseeable future I\u0026rsquo;m going to be blogging and working on the rest of it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s nothing more I can say. I\u0026rsquo;ll just keep working on it and this post will continue to be updated.\nAnd thank you for reading this. See you later!\n","permalink":"https://sunnycloudyang.github.io/posts/post1/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s my first post, machine-translated, ugly, and meaningless.","title":"First Post"},{"content":"Bounce Balls Introduction Welcome to the Balls Universe Brand new interface with brand new experience In short, it\u0026rsquo;s a simple universe with just balls, you can make it chaotic or just in peace and love, that\u0026rsquo;s up to you. (It breaks your browser not mine after all)\nhiahia (╯`□′)╯BOMBS! •••*～●)\nAxiom System Newtonian laws of mechanics Galilean velocity transformation SunnyCloudYang\u0026rsquo;s collision mode Portals -\u0026gt; Click here to enter the old balls universe -\u0026gt; Click here to enter the BRAND NEW balls universe -\u0026gt; Click here to beat the wooden fish to gain merits🙏 -\u0026gt; Click here to download WoodBlock app(for Android) Tutorials (Please read it carefully!) Ⅰ . Primary Balls Simulator By clicking the headline of the page (Welcome to xxx), you can check the version of the current universe; The input box (could have) (now it works) can change the amount of balls rapidly; Clicking \u0026lsquo;Gravity\u0026rsquo; will take gravity into account (and it will enable energy loss as well); clicking \u0026lsquo;Energy loss\u0026rsquo; will do what it\u0026rsquo;s name implies; clicking \u0026lsquo;Universe mode\u0026rsquo; will add gravity between the balls, they will attract each other; In \u0026lsquo;Custom\u0026rsquo; tab you can define the scale/speed of the balls, gravity constant and background color on your own, just feel free to drag the bar; Advanced hidden options: Double click \u0026lsquo;Gravity\u0026rsquo; tab can enable/disable gravity follow mode, which means the ball will always fall towards the ground in your real life. The default value is enable; Double click \u0026lsquo;Energy Loss\u0026rsquo; tab can enable/disable shake mode, you can shake the balls by shaking your device (notice that PC usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a acceleration sensor). The default value is disable; You can NOT open \u0026lsquo;shake mode\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;gravity follow\u0026rsquo; at the same time right now!; Double click \u0026lsquo;Universe mode\u0026rsquo; tab can enable/disable merge mode, the lager ball will eat the smaller one in the collision. The default value is enable; Double click \u0026lsquo;Day mode\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Night mode\u0026rsquo; tab can enable/disable tail shadow (to make it prettier or uglier). The default value is disable; Double click Custom tab? That makes no sense. You can drag any ball by clicking it inside, and release it by releasing the left mouse button; If you got stuck by some bugs, just refresh the page, which will restart the universe; The collision now fully abide by the physics laws, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it; On the PC, there is much more room for the balls, so usually it can contain up to 700 balls; while on the mobile device, you can experience shake mode; (so maybe the best choice is to use a pad) The 🔒 on the top right corner can lock the screen scroll, maybe useful sometimes; Super advanced hidden options: Press F12 to open the console, balls[i] corresponds to each ball. You can assign a valid value to its mess/radius/x/y/vx/vy (eg. balls[0].mess = 114514;) , and there is usually no restrictions about that. But use that carefully in case it breaks your browser Ⅱ. Brand New Balls Universe 本模式为全屏纯享版，采用了全新的UI设计，适合作为壁纸或者对界面比较挑剔的有艺术眼光的优秀的你！ 左上角为当前球数统计，支持单击直接快速批量改变小球数量，UI还在优化中 右上角点击设置图标可以打开设置菜单，单击其他地方/设置图标/Save/Cancel可以关闭菜单。上下滚一滚？目前可以自定义的变量几乎都在那儿了 ⚠️ATTENTION: All your settings will only take effects after you SAVE them! 相信你已经看完了初代模拟器的操作指南(right?)，在这个版本中所有的双击操作都作为开关直接呈现，避免了记不住的尴尬 限制说明：在这个版本中，我们加入了一些限制，以 限制你的作恶能力 尽力呈现最好的使用体验，主要有如下几点： Universe模式与Gravity模式不可得兼（什么你说你在卡门线分不清在地表还是在宇宙？不知道，听不清，不在乎🙉）； Gravity模式下强制加入了能量损失（毕竟都在地面上了，也得入乡随俗吧），当你关闭Gravity模式，Energy Loss会自动恢复至开启Gravity之前时的状态（好贴心！他真的，我哭死） Ground Pointing模式和Shake模式不可得兼，因为Ground Pointing采集的加速度包括了你死命摇手机时产生的加速度 所以不必画蛇添足，脱裤裤放屁 如果想打开Shake模式，请先关闭Ground Pointing 重点：在小球上按住鼠标可以控制并拖动小球横冲直撞，而在没有小球的地方按住鼠标会制造一个新的小球（并暂停所有运动），拖动鼠标可以控制其大小（极限值取决于你设置的最大/最小球半径），如果不想控制大小的话单击会默认创造和上一次一样大的小球 Suggestions I suggest turning down the Graviation const under \u0026lsquo;Universe mode\u0026rsquo;. (suggested: 0.200~0.450)； The previous suggestion is really important! Features Bug performance; Sometimes energy is not quite conserved No longer exists; Sometimes momentum is also not quite conserved No longer exists; It may make you relax and angry at the same time.
